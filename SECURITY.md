## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email Security Team
Send an email to: `security@ytsbyai.com`

### 3. Include the following information:
- **Type of issue**: Buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.
- **Full paths of source file(s)**: Related to the vulnerability
- **The number of line(s)**: Where the vulnerability exists
- **Any special configuration**: Required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions**: To reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code**: If available
- **Impact of the issue**: Including how an attacker might exploit it

### 4. What to expect:
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Regular updates on the progress
- **Public Disclosure**: After the issue is fixed and deployed

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit
- API keys and secrets stored securely
- Input validation and sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Regular security updates
- Network isolation and firewalls

### Code Security
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret scanning in CI/CD
- CodeQL analysis for security issues

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, or tokens
2. **Use environment variables**: For all configuration
3. **Validate inputs**: Sanitize all user inputs
4. **Follow OWASP guidelines**: For web application security
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regular security updates

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords**: Unique passwords for each service
2. **Enable 2FA**: Two-factor authentication when available
3. **Report suspicious activity**: Contact security team immediately
4. **Keep software updated**: Use latest browser and OS versions
